# Python PBL Project 2020
#### Powered By Neko.vecter Kalashnikov Bill

Adopt Python to Perform Basic Statistical Data Analysis and Visualize the Results 

Code for 2020 computer programming PBL (Problem-Based Learning method) project.



### Project Mission 

Make Python program to analyze data than export an excel document.

#### 	About Excel Document

​		Export Excel document will include a table that show all data. Also, will show a visual pie chart in document.


### Learning Objective

- Understand and interpret user requirements in real-world contexts properly.

- At the theoretical level

  - Design an appropriate algorithm to perform the analysis to achieve the desired data. 

- At the engineering level

  - Manipulate the data in Excel and visualize the results in Pie graph.


- At the thinking level

  - Develop computational thinking, i.e., divide and conquer. 
- Develop independent thinking.
